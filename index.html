          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Nelson Mandela life:</h3>
          <p>
              Originally from the Xhosa people and part of the Tembu royal house, Mandela studied Law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of the Witwatersrand. When he resided in Johannesburg, he became involved in the anti-colonialist policy, which is why he joined the queues of the African National Congress, and subsequently founded its Youth League. After taking power from the National Party in 1948, he gained prominence during the 1952 Campaña del Desafío and was elected regional president of the African National Congress in the province of Transvaal. He presided over the 1955 Popular Congress. In his practice as a lawyer, he was arrested several times for seditious activities and, as part of the CNA directive, he was prosecuted in court for treason from 1956 to 1961. Influenced by Marxism, he entered in secret the South African Communist Party (SACP) and was part of its central committee. Despite being in favor of non-violent protests, in association with the SACP he founded and commanded the guerrilla organization Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) or «La Lanza de la Nación» in 1961.2​ In 1962 he was arrested and accused of conspiracy to overthrow al gobierno, for what he was sentenced to life imprisonment during the Proceso de Rivonia.
